# ‚ö° Bolt Project

The **Bolt Project** is an innovative energy-harvesting system designed to generate electricity through the omnidirectional rotation of a ball. The device is strategically positioned at the center of the ball and leverages motion, mechanics, and airflow to produce power efficiently and safely.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on converting the kinetic energy from a rotating spherical system into electrical energy. The core system uses two motors mounted orthogonally (90¬∞ apart) with pendulums attached to their axes. The movement of the ball causes the pendulums to rotate, which in turn powers the motors to generate electricity.

## üõ† How It Works

- **Dual-Motor Setup**: Two motors are fixed at right angles to each other. Each has a pendulum arm attached to its axis.
- **Pendulum Mechanics**: As the ball rotates in any direction, gravitational forces cause the pendulums to move, rotating the motor shafts and generating electricity.
- **Airless Ball Shell**: The ball surrounding the device is airless to allow smooth rotation and includes ventilation paths for airflow.
- **Cooling System**: Natural air movement through the ball helps cool the internal components during operation.
- **Safety Mechanism**: The airless ball design also helps prevent the device from overheating or bursting under pressure.
- **Central Fixation**: The energy-generating unit is suspended or fixed at the exact center of the ball for stability and efficient power conversion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

- 2 x Brushless DC Motors (BLDC) or Dynamo Motors
- 2 x Pendulum Arms (adjustable weight and length)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or ESP32) for monitoring
- Rectifier & Voltage Regulation Circuit
- Airless Spherical Shell (protective outer ball)
- Internal frame for central mounting
- Heat-resistant ventilation grid

## üå¨ Cooling and Safety

The airless design allows controlled airflow to pass through internal channels:
- Prevents component overheating
- Reduces internal pressure
- Acts as a buffer to prevent explosion or system damage under high motion loads

## üí° Applications
